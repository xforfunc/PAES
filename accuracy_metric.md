Dear Tutor/Professor,

While I successfully managed to run the accuracy metric within the A4S framework, I have **chosen not to submit** that implementation at this stage.

The reason is that I relied heavily on PyCharm’s integrated AI assistance to complete the code. Although the metric executes correctly, I do not yet feel confident that I fully understand the implementation, and therfore did not wish to submit it.

As context, the cybersecurity cohort (myself included) is enrolled in a mandatory Programming Fundamentals module that assumes no prior coding experience or Python knowledge.

I have some minor experience as a hobbyist coder in Rust, which I hope will help me catch up quickly, but my goal remains to ensure that all submitted code reflects my own understanding and effort. For reference our cohort is so heterogenous that within it there are professional coders, hobbyist level enthusiasts like myself, and people who are learning what an if statement is.

I want to internalize each step rather than rely on assisted generation, so I’m taking the time to learn Python, torch, pandas, numpy etc, and build confidence in each concept.

Hopefully this choice won’t reflect a lack of work or motivation, but a conscious decision to uphold academic honesty and the learning intent of the course. Further commits will follow once I have replicated the metric fully and can demonstrate clear comprehension of each part.

I am aware there’s a bit of catchup to be made here, but see it is an opportunity to learn.

Yours Faithfully
